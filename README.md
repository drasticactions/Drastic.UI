# Drastic.UI

**Yet another "Quick And Dirty" Cross Platform Desktop Framework**, for macOS and Windows.

## What it's about:

Drastic UI is a cross-platform UI framework for macOS and Windows, intended for quickly hacking together UI. Unlike other frameworks that aim for beautiful UIs with an artistic vision that looks great on the app store, Drastic.UI is for the "I just need a button and a click handler" crowd. 

A direct port of the macOS Forms platforms, Drastic UI has all of its features. I've only changed the namespace (to not conflict with Xamarin Forms) and updated the implementations to work on .NET6+. All included controls should work as they do in Xamarin Forms 5, but honestly, I only cared about the grid and buttons. YMMV.

I do not intend Drastic UI as a "Production" framework. It's a hack that lets me quickly make a UI with an API I already know, which could be helpful for others in the same situation.
